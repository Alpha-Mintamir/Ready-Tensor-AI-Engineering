Their reformist ideas,  \\nby destroying the unity of the state \\nchurch, threatened to divide the \\npeople and to undermine royal  \\nauthority .\\nIn 1607 a small group of Sepa -\\nratists — a radical sect of Puritans \\nwho did not believe the Established \\nChurch could ever be reformed — \\ndeparted for Leyden, Holland, where \\nthe Dutch granted them asylum  . \\nHowever, the Calvinist Dutch re -\\nstricted them mainly to low-paid la-\\nboring jobs  . Some members of the \\ncongregation grew dissatisfied with \\nthis discrimination and resolved to \\nemigrate to the New World .\\nIn 1620, a group of Leyden Puri -\\ntans secured a land patent from the \\nVirginia Company . Numbering 101, \\nthey set out for Virginia on the May-\\nflower . A storm sent them far north \\nand they landed in New England \\non Cape Cod  . Believing themselves \\noutside the jurisdiction of any orga -\\nnized government, the men drafted \\na formal agreement to abide by “just \\nand equal laws” drafted by leaders \\nof their own choosing . This was the \\nMayflower Compact .\\nIn December the Mayflower \\nreached Plymouth harbor; the Pil -\\ngrims began to build their settle -\\nment during the winter . Nearly half \\nthe colonists died of exposure and \\ndisease, but neighboring Wampa -\\nnoag Indians provided the informa-\\ntion that would sustain them: how \\nto grow maize  . By the next fall, the \\nPilgrims had a plentiful crop of corn, \\nand a growing trade based on furs \\nand lumber .\\nA new wave of immigrants ar -\\nrived on the shores of Massachusetts \\nBay in 1630 bearing a grant from \\nKing Charles I to establish a colony  . \\nMany of them were Puritans whose \\nreligious practices were increasingly \\nprohibited in England .

The Anasazi flourished over the centuries, developing sophisticated \\ndams and irrigation systems; creating a masterful, distinctive pottery tradi-\\ntion; and carving multiroom dwellings into the sheer sides of cliffs that remain \\namong the most striking archaeological sites in the United States today.\\nYet by the year 1300, they had abandoned their settlements, leaving their \\npottery, implements, even clothing — as though they intended to return — and \\nseemingly vanished into history. Their homeland remained empty of human \\nbeings for more than a century — until the arrival of new tribes, such as the \\nNavajo and the Ute, followed by the Spanish and other European settlers.\\nThe story of the Anasazi is tied inextricably to the beautiful but harsh \\nenvironment in which they chose to live. Early settlements, consisting of simple \\npithouses scooped out of the ground, evolved into sunken kivas (underground \\nrooms) that served as meeting and religious sites. Later generations developed \\nthe masonry techniques for building square, stone pueblos. But the most dra-\\nmatic change in Anasazi living was the move to the cliff sides below the flat-\\ntopped mesas, where the Anasazi carved their amazing, multilevel dwellings.\\nThe Anasazi lived in a communal society. They traded with other peoples \\nin the region, but signs of warfare are few and isolated. And although the Ana-\\nsazi certainly had religious and other leaders, as well as skilled artisans, social \\nor class distinctions were virtually nonexistent.\\nReligious and social motives undoubtedly played a part in the building \\nof the cliff communities and their final abandonment. But the struggle to raise \\nfood in an increasingly difficult environment was probably the paramount fac-\\ntor. As populations grew, farmers planted larger areas on the mesas, causing \\nsome communities to farm marginal lands, while others left the mesa tops for \\nthe cliffs. But the Anasazi couldn’t halt the steady loss of the land’s fertility \\nfrom constant use, nor withstand the region’s cyclical droughts. Analysis of tree \\nrings, for example, shows that a drought lasting 23 years, from 1276 to 1299, \\nfinally forced the last groups of Anasazi to leave permanently.\\nAlthough the Anasazi dispersed from their ancestral homeland, their \\nlegacy remains in the remarkable archaeological record that they left behind, \\nand in the Hopi, Zuni, and other Pueblo peoples who are their descendants. \\ue075\\nTHE ENDURING MYSTERY OF THE ANASAZI\\nCHAPTER 1: EARLY AMERICA'),\n",

Most of its settlers — whether \\nthe younger sons of aristocrats, religious dissenters, or impoverished inden-\\ntured servants — came there lured by a promise of opportunity or freedom not  \\navailable in the Old World. The first Americans were reborn free, establishing \\nthemselves in a wilderness unencumbered by any social order other than that \\nof the primitive aboriginal peoples they displaced. Having left the baggage of \\na feudal order behind them, they faced few obstacles to the development of a \\nsociety built on the principles of political and social liberalism that emerged \\nwith difficulty in 17th- and 18th-century Europe. Based on the thinking of the \\nphilosopher John Locke, this sort of liberalism emphasized the rights of the \\nindividual and constraints on government power.\\nMost immigrants to America came from the British Isles, the most  \\nliberal of the European polities along with The Netherlands. In religion, the \\nmajority adhered to various forms of Calvinism with its emphasis on both \\ndivine and secular contractual relationships. These greatly facilitated the \\nemergence of a social order built on individual rights and social mobility. The \\ndevelopment of a more complex and highly structured commercial society in \\ncoastal cities by the mid-18th century did not stunt this trend; it was in these \\ncities that the American Revolution was made. The constant reconstruction \\nof society along an ever-receding Western frontier equally contributed to a \\nliberal-democratic spirit.\\nIn Europe, ideals of individual rights advanced slowly and unevenly; the \\nconcept of democracy was even more alien.

The effort to \\ndestroy a neofeudal society while establishing the rights of man and democrat-\\nic fraternity generated terror, dictatorship, and Napoleonic despotism.

They \\naccused several women of being witches. The townspeople were appalled but \\nnot surprised: Belief in witchcraft was widespread throughout 17th-century \\nAmerica and Europe. Town officials convened a court to hear the charges of \\nwitchcraft. Within a month, six women were convicted and hanged.\\nThe hysteria grew, in large measure because the court permitted wit-\\nnesses to testify that they had seen the accused as spirits or in visions. Such \\n“spectral evidence” could neither be verified nor made subject to objective \\nexamination. By the fall of 1692, 20 victims, including several men, had been \\nexecuted, and more than 100 others were in jail (where another five victims \\ndied) — among them some of the town’s most prominent citizens. When the \\ncharges threatened to spread beyond Salem, ministers throughout the colony \\ncalled for an end to the trials. The governor of the colony agreed. Those still \\nin jail were later acquitted or given reprieves.\\nAlthough an isolated incident, the Salem episode has long fascinated \\nAmericans. Most historians agree that Salem Village in 1692 experienced a \\nkind of public hysteria, fueled by a genuine belief in the existence of witch-\\ncraft. While some of the girls may have been acting, many responsible adults \\nbecame caught up in the frenzy as well.\\nEven more revealing is a closer analysis of the identities of the ac-\\ncused and the accusers. Salem Village, as much of colonial New England, \\nwas undergoing an economic and political transition from a largely agrarian, \\nPuritan-dominated community to a more commercial, secular society. Many \\nof the accusers were representatives of a traditional way of life tied to farming \\nand the church, whereas a number of the accused witches were members of a \\nrising commercial class of small shopkeepers and tradesmen. Salem’s obscure \\nstruggle for social and political power between older traditional groups and a \\nnewer commercial class was one repeated in communities throughout Ameri-\\ncan history. It took a bizarre and deadly detour when its citizens were swept \\nup by the conviction that the devil was loose in their homes.\\nThe Salem witch trials also serve as a dramatic parable of the deadly \\nconsequences of making sensational, but false, charges.

The Royal Proclama -\\ntion of 1763 reserved all the west -\\nern territory between the Allegheny \\nMountains, Florida, the Mississippi \\nRiver, and Quebec for use by Na -\\ntive Americans .

Although \\nnever effectively enforced, this mea-\\nsure, in the eyes of the colonists, con-\\nstituted a high-handed disregard of \\ntheir fundamental right to occupy \\nand settle western lands .\\nMore serious in its repercus -\\nsions was the new British revenue \\npolicy . London needed more money \\nto support its growing empire and \\nfaced growing taxpayer discontent at \\nhome . It seemed reasonable enough \\nthat the colonies should pay for their \\nown defense . That would involve new \\ntaxes, levied by Parliament — at the \\nexpense of colonial self-government .\\nThe first step was the replacement \\nof the Molasses Act of 1733, which \\nplaced a prohibitive duty, or tax, \\non the import of rum and molas -\\nses from non-English areas, with the \\nSugar Act of 1764 . This act outlawed \\nthe importation of foreign rum; it \\nalso put a modest duty on molas -\\nses from all sources and levied taxes \\non wines, silks, coffee, and a num -\\nber of other luxury items  . The hope \\nwas that lowering the duty on mo -\\nlasses would reduce the temptation \\nto smuggle the commodity from the \\nDutch and French West Indies for \\nthe rum distilleries of New England . \\nThe British government enforced the \\nSugar Act energetically . Customs of-\\nficials were ordered to show more \\neffectiveness . British warships in \\nAmerican waters were instructed to \\nseize smugglers, and “writs of assis -\\ntance,” or warrants, authorized the \\nking’s officers to search suspected \\npremises .\\nBoth the duty imposed by the Sug-\\nar Act and the measures to enforce \\nit caused consternation among New \\nEngland merchants .

It attracted the attention of a political intelligentsia throughout the \\nEuropean continent. Idealistic notables such as Thaddeus Kosciusko, Friedrich \\nvon Steuben, and the Marquis de Lafayette joined its ranks to affirm liberal \\nideas they hoped to transfer to their own nations. Its success strengthened the \\nconcept of natural rights throughout the Western world and furthered the En-\\nlightenment rationalist critique of an old order built around hereditary monar-\\nchy and an established church. In a very real sense, it was a precursor to the \\nFrench Revolution, but it lacked the French Revolution’s violence and chaos \\nbecause it had occurred in a society that was already fundamentally liberal.\\nThe ideas of the Revolution have been most often depicted as a triumph \\nof the social contract/natural rights theories of John Locke. Correct so far as it \\ngoes, this characterization passes too quickly over the continuing importance \\nof Calvinist-dissenting Protestantism, which from the Pilgrims and Puritans on \\nhad also stood for the ideals of the social contract and the self-governing com-\\nmunity. Lockean intellectuals and the Protestant clergy were both important \\nadvocates of compatible strains of liberalism that had flourished in the British \\nNorth American colonies.\\nScholars have also argued that another persuasion contributed to the \\nRevolution: “republicanism.” Republicanism, they assert, did not deny the \\nexistence of natural rights but subordinated them to the belief that the main-\\ntenance of a free republic required a strong sense of communal responsibility \\nand the cultivation of self-denying virtue among its leaders. The assertion of \\nindividual rights, even the pursuit of individual happiness, seemed egoistic by \\ncontrast. For a time republicanism threatened to displace natural rights as the \\nmajor theme of the Revolution. Most historians today, however, concede that \\nthe distinction was much overdrawn. Most individuals who thought about such \\nthings in the 18th century envisioned the two ideas more as different sides of \\nthe same intellectual coin.\\nRevolution usually entails social upheaval and violence on a wide scale. \\nBy these criteria, the American Revolution was relatively mild. About 100,000 \\nLoyalists left the new United States. Some thousands were members of old \\nelites who had suffered expropriation of their property and been expelled; \\nothers were simply common people faithful to their King. The majority of \\nthose who went into exile did so voluntarily. The Revolution did open up and \\nfurther liberalize an already liberal society. In New York and the Carolinas, \\nlarge Loyalist estates were divided among small farmers. Liberal assumptions \\nbecame the official norm of American political culture — whether in the dis-\\nestablishment of the Anglican Church, the principle of elected national and \\nstate executives, or the wide dissemination of the idea of individual freedom. \\nYet the structure of society changed little.

These influences led to the \\nconviction that three equal and co -\\nordinate branches of government \\nshould be established  . Legislative, \\nexecutive, and judicial powers were \\nto be so harmoniously balanced that \\nno one could ever gain control  . The \\ndelegates agreed that the legislative \\nbranch, like the colonial legislatures \\nand the British Parliament, should \\nconsist of two houses .\\nOn these points there was una -\\nnimity within the assembly  . But \\nsharp differences also arose  . Repre-\\nsentatives of the small states — New \\nJersey, for instance — objected to \\nchanges that would reduce their in -\\nfluence in the national government \\nby basing representation upon popu-\\nlation rather than upon statehood, \\nas was the case under the Articles of \\nConfederation .\\nOn the other hand, representa -\\ntives of large states, like Virginia, \\nargued for proportionate represen -\\ntation . This debate threatened to go \\non endlessly until Roger Sherman  \\ncame forward with arguments for \\nrepresentation in proportion to the \\npopulation of the states in one house \\nof Congress, the House of Represen-\\ntatives, and equal representation in \\nthe other, the Senate .\\nThe alignment of large against \\nsmall states then dissolved  . But al -\\nmost every succeeding question \\nraised new divisions, to be resolved \\nonly by new compromises . Northern-\\ners wanted slaves counted when de -\\ntermining each state’s tax share, but \\nnot in determining the number of \\nseats a state would have in the House \\nof Representatives  . Under a com -\\npromise reached with little dissent, \\ntax levies and House membership \\nwould be apportioned according to \\nthe number of free inhabitants plus \\nthree-fifths of the slaves .\\nCertain members, such as Sher -\\nman and Elbridge Gerry, still smart-\\ning from Shays’s Rebellion, feared \\nthat the mass of people lacked suf -\\nficient wisdom to govern themselves \\nand thus wished no branch of the \\nfederal government to be elected di-\\nrectly by the people . Others thought \\nthe national government should be \\ngiven as broad a popular base as \\npossible . Some delegates wished to \\nexclude the growing West from the \\nopportunity of statehood; others \\nchampioned the equality principle \\nestablished in the Northwest Ordi -\\nnance of 1787 .\\nThere was no serious difference \\non such national economic ques -\\ntions as paper money, laws concern-\\ning contract obligations, or the role \\nof women, who were excluded from \\npolitics .

But it was quickly seen that the \\napplication of force upon the states \\nwould destroy the Union . The deci -\\nsion was that the government should \\nnot act upon the states but upon the \\npeople within the states, and should \\nlegislate for and upon all the indi -\\nvidual residents of the country  . As \\nthe keystone of the Constitution, the \\nconvention adopted two brief but \\nhighly significant statements:\\nCongress shall have power ... \\nto make all Laws which shall be \\nnecessary and proper for carrying \\ninto Execution the ... Powers \\nvested by this Constitution in the \\nGovernment of the United States. \\n... (Article I, Section 7)\\nThis Constitution, and the \\nLaws of the United States which \\nshall be made in Pursuance \\nthereof; and all Treaties made, or \\nwhich shall be made, under the \\nAuthority of the United States, \\nshall be the supreme Law of the \\nLand; and the Judges in every \\nState shall be bound thereby, \\nany Thing in the Constitution or \\nLaws of any State to the Contrary \\nnotwithstanding.

In 1913 his-\\ntorian Charles Beard, in An Econom-\\nic Interpretation of the Constitution , \\nargued that the Founding Fathers \\nrepresented emerging commercial-\\ncapitalist interests that needed a \\nstrong national government  . He \\nalso believed many may have been \\nmotivated by personal holdings of \\nlarge amounts of depreciated gov -\\nernment securities . However, James \\nMadison, principal drafter of the \\nConstitution, held no bonds and \\nwas a Virginia planter  . Conversely, \\nsome opponents of the Constitu -\\ntion owned large amounts of bonds \\nand securities  . Economic interests \\ninfluenced the course of the debate,  \\nbut so did state, sectional, and ideo -\\nlogical interests  . Equally important \\nwas the idealism of the framers  . \\nProducts of the Enlightenment, the \\nFounding Fathers designed a gov -\\nernment that they believed would \\npromote individual liberty and pub-\\nlic virtue  .

The state militias were \\npoorly trained and undisciplined .\\nHostilities began with an inva -\\nsion of Canada, which, if properly \\ntimed and executed, would have \\nbrought united action against Mon -\\ntreal . Instead, the entire campaign \\nmiscarried and ended with the Brit -\\nish occupation of Detroit  .

Nevertheless, the Brit -\\nish fleet harassed the Eastern sea -\\nboard with orders to “destroy and \\nlay waste .” On the night of August \\n24, 1814, an expeditionary force \\nrouted American militia, marched to \\nWashington, D .C ., and left the city \\nin flames  .

In reaction to the secularism of the age, \\na religious revival spread westward in the first half of the 19th century.\\nThis “Second Great Awakening” consisted of several kinds of activity, \\ndistinguished by locale and expression of religious commitment. In New \\nEngland, the renewed interest in religion inspired a wave of social activism. \\nIn western New York, the spirit of revival encouraged the emergence of new \\ndenominations. In the Appalachian region of Kentucky and Tennessee, the \\nrevival strengthened the Methodists and the Baptists, and spawned a new form \\nof religious expression — the camp meeting.\\nIn contrast to the Great Awakening of the 1730s, the revivals in the \\nEast were notable for the absence of hysteria and open emotion. Rather, \\nunbelievers were awed by the “respectful silence” of those bearing witness \\nto their faith. The evangelical enthusiasm in New England gave rise to \\ninterdenominational missionary societies, formed to evangelize the West. \\nMembers of these societies not only acted as apostles for the faith, but as \\neducators, civic leaders, and exponents of Eastern, urban culture. Publication \\nand education societies promoted Christian education. Most notable among \\nthem was the American Bible Society, founded in 1816. Social activism \\ninspired by the revival gave rise to abolition of slavery groups and the Society \\nfor the Promotion of Temperance, as well as to efforts to reform prisons and \\ncare for the handicapped and mentally ill.\\nWestern New York, from Lake Ontario to the Adirondack Mountains, had \\nbeen the scene of so many religious revivals in the past that it was known as \\nthe “Burned-Over District.” Here, the dominant figure was Charles Grandison \\nFinney, a lawyer who had experienced a religious epiphany and set out to \\npreach the Gospel. His revivals were characterized by careful planning, \\nshowmanship, and advertising. Finney preached in the Burned-Over District \\nthroughout the 1820s and the early 1830s, before moving to Ohio in 1835  \\nto take a chair in theology at Oberlin College, of which he subsequently \\nbecame president.\\nTwo other important religious denominations in America — the Mormons \\nand the Seventh Day Adventists — also got their start in the Burned- \\nOver District.\\nTHE SECOND GREAT AWAKENING'),\n",

But here, the center of the \\nrevival was the camp meeting, a religious service of several days’ length, for \\na group that was obliged to take shelter on the spot because of the distance \\nfrom home. Pioneers in thinly populated areas looked to the camp meeting \\nas a refuge from the lonely life on the frontier. The sheer exhilaration of \\nparticipating in a religious revival with hundreds and perhaps thousands \\nof people inspired the dancing, shouting, and singing associated with these \\nevents. Probably the largest camp meeting was at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, in \\nAugust 1801; between 10,000 and 25,000 people attended.\\nThe great revival quickly spread throughout Kentucky, Tennessee, and \\nsouthern Ohio, with the Methodists and the Baptists its prime beneficiaries. \\nEach denomination had assets that allowed it to thrive on the frontier. The \\nMethodists had a very efficient organization that depended on ministers — \\nknown as circuit riders — who sought out people in remote frontier locations. \\nThe circuit riders came from among the common people and possessed a \\nrapport with the frontier families they hoped to convert. The Baptists had \\nno formal church organization. Their farmer-preachers were people who \\nreceived “the call” from God, studied the Bible, and founded a church, which \\nthen ordained them. Other candidates for the ministry emerged from these \\nchurches, and established a presence farther into the wilderness. Using such \\nmethods, the Baptists became dominant throughout the border states and  \\nmost of the South.\\nThe Second Great Awakening exercised a profound impact on American \\nhistory. The numerical strength of the Baptists and Methodists rose relative \\nto that of the denominations dominant in the colonial period — Anglicans, \\nPresbyterians, and Congregationalists.

By 1860, the new \\nwork day had become law in sever -\\nal of the states and was a generally  \\naccepted standard .\\nThe spread of suffrage had al -\\nready led to a new concept of  \\neducation . Clear-sighted statesmen \\neverywhere understood that uni -\\nversal suffrage required a tutored, \\nliterate electorate  .

At a time \\nwhen women were often forbidden \\nto speak in public places, Wright not \\nonly spoke out, but shocked audi -\\nences by her views advocating the \\nrights of women to seek information \\non birth control and divorce .

Taking the abolitionist Wil -\\nliam Lloyd Garrison as her model, \\nshe saw that the key to success lay \\nin changing public opinion, and not \\nin party action .

It moved in a westward direction for \\nnearly 300 years through densely forested wilderness and barren plains until \\nthe decennial census of 1890 revealed that at last the United States no longer \\npossessed a discernible line of settlement.\\nAt the time it seemed to many that a long period had come to an end — \\none in which the country had grown from a few struggling outposts of  \\nEnglish civilization to a huge independent nation with an identity of its own. \\nIt was easy to believe that the experience of settlement and post-settlement \\ndevelopment, constantly repeated as a people conquered a continent, had been \\nthe defining factor in the nation’s development.\\nIn 1893, the historian Frederick Jackson Turner, expressing a widely held \\nsentiment, declared that the frontier had made the United States more than an \\nextension of Europe. It had created a nation with a culture that was perhaps \\ncoarser than Europe’s, but also more pragmatic, energetic, individualistic, and \\ndemocratic. The existence of large areas of “free land” had created a nation of \\nproperty holders and had provided a “safety valve” for discontent in cities and \\nmore settled areas. His analysis implied that an America without a frontier \\nwould trend ominously toward what were seen as the European ills of strati-\\nfied social systems, class conflict, and diminished opportunity.\\nAfter more than a hundred years scholars still debate the significance of \\nthe frontier in American history. Few believe it was quite as all-important as \\nTurner suggested; its absence does not appear to have led to dire consequenc-\\nes. Some have gone farther, rejecting the Turner argument as a romantic glo-\\nrification of a bloody, brutal process — marked by a war of conquest against \\nMexico, near-genocidal treatment of Native American tribes, and environmen-\\ntal despoliation. The common experience of the frontier, they argue, was one \\nof hardship and failure.\\nYet it remains hard to believe that three centuries of westward movement \\nhad no impact on the national character and suggestive that intelligent foreign \\nobservers, such as the French intellectual Alexis de Tocqueville, were fasci-\\nnated by the American West. Indeed, the last area of frontier settlement, the \\nvast area stretching north from Texas to the Canadian border, which Ameri-\\ncans today commonly call “the West,” still seems characterized by ideals of \\nindividualism, democracy, and opportunity that are more palpable than in the \\nrest of the nation.

In the North, sen -\\ntiment for outright abolition grew \\nincreasingly powerful  . Southern -\\ners in general felt little guilt about \\nslavery and defended it vehemently  . \\nIn some seaboard areas, slavery by \\n1850 was well over 200 years old; \\nit was an integral part of the basic \\neconomy of the region .\\nAlthough the 1860 census showed \\nthat there were nearly four million \\nslaves out of a total population of \\n12 .3 million in the 15 slave states, \\nonly a minority of Southern whites \\nowned slaves  . There were some \\n385,000 slave owners out of about \\n1 .5 million white families  . Fifty per-\\ncent of these slave owners owned no \\nmore than five slaves . Twelve percent \\nowned 20 or more slaves, the num -\\nber defined as turning a farmer into \\na planter .

But the American farmer  \\ngrew enough grain and cotton, \\nraised enough beef and pork, and \\nclipped enough wool not only to \\nsupply American workers and their \\nfamilies but also to create ever-in -\\ncreasing surpluses .\\nSeveral factors accounted for this \\nextraordinary achievement . One was \\nthe expansion into the West . Anoth-\\ner was a technological revolution  . \\nThe farmer of 1800, using a hand \\nsickle, could hope to cut a fifth of \\na hectare of wheat a day  . With the \\ncradle, 30 years later, he might cut \\nfour-fifths . In 1840 Cyrus McCor -\\nmick performed a miracle by cutting \\nfrom two to two-and-a-half hectares \\na day with the reaper, a machine he \\nhad been developing for nearly 10 \\nyears . He headed west to the young \\nprairie town of Chicago, where he \\nset up a factory — and by 1860 sold a \\nquarter of a million reapers .\\nOther farm machines were de -\\nveloped in rapid succession: the  \\nautomatic wire binder, the threshing \\n(Continued on page 177.)\\nCHAPTER 8: GROWTH AND TRANSFORMATION \\n160'),\n",

Big \\nindustry required big amounts of capital; headlong economic growth required \\nforeign investors. John Pierpont (J.P.) Morgan was the most important of the \\nAmerican financiers who underwrote both requirements.\\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Morgan headed the \\nnation’s largest investment banking firm. It brokered American securities to \\nwealthy elites at home and abroad. Since foreigners needed assurance that \\ntheir investments were in a stable currency, Morgan had a strong interest in \\nkeeping the dollar tied to its legal value in gold. In the absence of an official \\nU.S. central bank, he became the de facto manager of the task.\\nFrom the 1880s through the early 20th century, Morgan and Company \\nnot only managed the securities that underwrote many important corporate \\nconsolidations, it actually originated some of them. The most stunning of these \\nwas the U.S. Steel Corporation, which combined Carnegie Steel with several \\nother companies. Its corporate stock and bonds were sold to investors at the \\nthen-unprecedented sum of $1.4 billion.\\nMorgan originated, and made large profits from, numerous other merg-\\ners. Acting as primary banker to numerous railroads, moreover, he effectively \\nmuted competition among them. His organizational efforts brought stability to \\nAmerican industry by ending price wars to the disadvantage of farmers and \\nsmall manufacturers, who saw him as an oppressor. In 1901, when he estab-\\nlished the Northern Securities Company to control a group of major railroads, \\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt authorized a successful Sherman Antitrust Act \\nsuit to break up the merger.\\nActing as an unofficial central banker, Morgan took the lead in support-\\ning the dollar during the economic depression of the mid-1890s by marketing \\na large government bond issue that raised funds to replenish Treasury gold \\nsupplies. At the same time, his firm undertook a short-term guarantee of the \\nnation’s gold reserves. In 1907, he took the lead in organizing the New York \\nfinancial community to prevent a potentially ruinous string of bankruptcies. In \\nthe process, his own firm acquired a large independent steel company, which \\nit amalgamated with U.S. Steel. President Roosevelt personally approved the \\naction in order to avert a serious depression.\\nBy then, Morgan’s power was so great that most Americans instinctively \\ndistrusted and disliked him. With some exaggeration, reformers depicted him \\nas the director of a “money trust” that controlled America. By the time of his \\ndeath in 1913, the country was in the final stages of at last reestablishing a \\ncentral bank, the Federal Reserve System, that would assume much of the re-\\nsponsibility he had exercised unofficially.  \\ue075\\nJ.P.

Little of the wealth that \\nthe growth of the nation had gener -\\nated went to its workers  . Moreover, \\nwomen and children made up a high \\npercentage of the work force in some \\nindustries and often received but a \\nfraction of the wages a man could \\nearn . Periodic economic crises swept \\nthe nation, further eroding industri-\\nal wages and producing high levels \\nof unemployment .\\nAt the same time, technologi -\\ncal improvements, which added so \\nmuch to the nation’s productivity, \\ncontinually reduced the demand for \\nskilled labor . Yet the unskilled labor \\npool was constantly growing, as un -\\nprecedented numbers of immigrants \\n— 18 million between 1880 and 1910 \\n— entered the country, eager for \\nwork .\\nBefore 1874, when Massachusetts \\npassed the nation’s first legislation \\nlimiting the number of hours wom -\\nen and child factory workers could \\nperform to 10 hours a day, virtually \\nno labor legislation existed in the \\ncountry . It was not until the 1930s \\nthat the federal government would \\nbecome actively involved  . Until \\nthen, the field was left to the state \\nand local authorities, few of whom \\nwere as responsive to the workers as \\nthey were to wealthy industrialists .\\nThe laissez-faire capitalism that \\ndominated the second half of the \\n19th century and fostered huge con-\\ncentrations of wealth and power was \\nbacked by a judiciary that time and \\nagain ruled against those who chal -\\nlenged the system . In this, they were \\nmerely following the prevailing phi-\\nlosophy of the times  . Drawing on a \\nsimplified understanding of Dar -\\nwinian science, many social think -\\ners believed that both the growth of \\nlarge business at the expense of small \\nenterprise and the wealth of a few \\nalongside the poverty of many was \\n“survival of the fittest,” and an un -\\navoidable by-product of progress .\\nAmerican workers, especially the \\nskilled among them, appear to have \\nlived at least as well as their coun -\\nterparts in industrial Europe  . Still, \\nthe social costs were high  . As late \\nas the year 1900, the United States \\nhad the highest job-related fatality \\nrate of any industrialized nation in \\nthe world  . Most industrial workers \\nstill worked a 10-hour day (12 hours \\nin the steel industry), yet earned less \\nthan the minimum deemed neces -\\nsary for a decent life . The number of \\nchildren in the work force doubled \\nbetween 1870 and 1900 .\\nThe first major effort to orga -\\nnize workers’ groups on a nation -\\nwide basis appeared with the Noble \\nOrder of the Knights of Labor in \\n1869 . Originally a secret, ritualistic \\nsociety organized by Philadelphia \\ngarment workers and advocating a \\ncooperative program, it was open \\nto all workers, including African \\nAmericans, women, and farmers  . \\nThe Knights grew slowly until its \\nrailway workers’ unit won a strike'),\n",

During the first 15 years of the 20th century alone, over \\n13 million people came to the United States, many passing through Ellis  \\nIsland, the federal immigration center that opened in New York harbor in \\n1892. (Though no longer in service, Ellis Island reopened in 1992 as a  \\nmonument to the millions who crossed the nation’s threshold there.)\\nThe first official census in 1790 had numbered Americans at 3,929,214. \\nApproximately half of the population of the original 13 states was of English \\norigin; the rest were Scots-Irish, German, Dutch, French, Swedish, Welsh, \\nand Finnish. These white Europeans were mostly Protestants. A fifth of the \\npopulation was enslaved Africans.\\nFrom early on, Americans viewed immigrants as a necessary resource for \\nan expanding country. As a result, few official restrictions were placed upon \\nimmigration into the United States until the 1920s. As more and more im-\\nmigrants arrived, however, some Americans became fearful that their culture \\nwas threatened.\\nThe Founding Fathers, especially Thomas Jefferson, had been ambivalent \\nover whether or not the United States ought to welcome arrivals from every \\ncorner of the globe. Jefferson wondered whether democracy could ever rest \\nsafely in the hands of men from countries that revered monarchs or replaced \\nroyalty with mob rule. However, few supported closing the gates to newcomers \\nin a country desperate for labor.\\nImmigration lagged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries as wars dis-\\nrupted trans-Atlantic travel and European governments restricted movement \\nto retain young men of military age. Still, as European populations increased, \\nmore people on the same land constricted the size of farming lots to a point \\nwhere families could barely survive. Moreover, cottage industries were falling \\nvictim to an Industrial Revolution that was mechanizing production. Thou-\\nsands of artisans unwilling or unable to find jobs in factories were out of work \\nin Europe.\\nIn the mid-1840s millions more made their way to the United States as \\na result of a potato blight in Ireland and continual revolution in the German \\nhomelands.

The Johnson-Reed Immigration Act of 1924 permanently curtailed \\nthe influx of newcomers with quotas calculated on nation of origin.\\nThe Great Depression of the 1930s dramatically slowed immigration still \\nfurther. With public opinion generally opposed to immigration, even for per-\\nsecuted European minorities, relatively few refugees found sanctuary in the \\nUnited States after Adolf Hitler’s ascent to power in 1933.\\nThroughout the postwar decades, the United States continued to cling \\nto nationally based quotas. Supporters of the McCarran-Walter Act of 1952 \\nargued that quota relaxation might inundate the United States with Marxist \\nsubversives from Eastern Europe.\\nIn 1965 Congress replaced national quotas with hemispheric ones. Rela-\\ntives of U.S. citizens received preference, as did immigrants with job skills \\nin short supply in the United States. In 1978 the hemispheric quotas were \\nreplaced by a worldwide ceiling of 290,000, a limit reduced to 270,000 after \\npassage of the Refugee Act of 1980.\\nSince the mid-1970s, the United States has experienced a fresh wave of \\nimmigration, with arrivals from Asia, Africa, and Latin America transforming \\ncommunities throughout the country. Current estimates suggest a total annual \\narrival of approximately 600,000 legal newcomers to the United States.\\nBecause immigrant and refugee quotas remain well under demand, how-\\never, illegal immigration is still a major problem. Mexicans and other Latin \\nAmericans daily cross the Southwestern U.S. borders to find work, higher \\nwages, and improved education and health care for their families. Likewise, \\nthere is a substantial illegal migration from countries like China and other \\nAsian nations. Estimates vary, but some suggest that as many as 600,000  \\nillegals per year arrive in the United States.\\nLarge surges of immigration have historically created social strains along \\nwith economic and cultural dividends. Deeply ingrained in most Americans, \\nhowever, is the conviction that the Statue of Liberty does, indeed, stand as a \\nsymbol for the United States as she lifts her lamp before the “golden door,” \\nwelcoming those “yearning to breathe free.” This belief, and the sure knowl-\\nedge that their forebears were once immigrants, has kept the United States a \\nnation of nations.  \\ue075'),\n",

In the 1920s, bills to prohibit \\nthe teaching of evolution began ap -\\npearing in Midwestern and South -\\nern state legislatures  . Leading this \\ncrusade was the aging William Jen -\\nnings Bryan, long a spokesman for \\nthe values of the countryside as well \\nas a progressive politician  .

Working conditions \\nin many of these industries did improve. Some companies in the 1920s began \\nto institute “welfare capitalism” by offering workers various pension, profit-\\nsharing, stock option, and health plans to ensure their loyalty. Still, shop floor \\nenvironments were often hard and authoritarian.\\nThe 1920s saw the mass production industries redouble their efforts to \\nprevent the growth of unions, which under the American Federation of Labor \\n(AFL) had enjoyed some success during World War I. They did so by using \\nspies and armed strikebreakers and by firing those suspected of union sym-\\npathies. Independent unions were often accused of being Communist. At the \\nsame time, many companies formed their own compliant employee organiza-\\ntions, often called “company unions.”\\nTraditionally, state legislatures, reflecting the views of the American mid-\\ndle class, supported the concept of the “open shop,” which prevented a union \\nfrom being the exclusive representative of all workers. This made it easier for \\ncompanies to deny unions the right to collective bargaining and block union-\\nization through court enforcement.\\nBetween 1920 and 1929, union membership in the United States \\ndropped from about five million to three-and-a-half million. The large un-\\nskilled or semi-skilled industries remained unorganized.\\nThe onset of the Great Depression led to widespread unemployment. By \\n1933 there were over 12 million Americans out of work. In the automobile in-\\ndustry, for example, the work force was cut in half between 1929 and 1933. At \\nthe same time, wages dropped by two-thirds.\\nThe election of Franklin Roosevelt, however, was to change the status of \\nthe American industrial worker forever. The first indication that Roosevelt was \\ninterested in the well-being of workers came with the appointment of Frances \\nPerkins, a prominent social welfare advocate, to be his secretary of labor. \\n(Perkins was also the first woman to hold a Cabinet-level position.) The far-\\nreaching National Industrial Recovery Act sought to raise industrial wages, \\nlimit the hours in a work week, and eliminate child labor. Most importantly, \\nthe law recognized the right of employees “to organize and bargain collectively \\nthrough representatives of their own choosing.”\\nJohn L.

The passage of the National Labor Relations Act \\n(NLRA) in 1935 and the friendly attitude of the National Labor Relations \\nBoard put the power and authority of the federal government behind the CIO.\\nIts first targets were the notoriously anti-union auto and steel industries. \\nIn late 1936 a series of sit-down strikes, orchestrated by the fledgling United \\nAuto Workers union under Walter Reuther, erupted at General Motors plants \\nin Cleveland, Ohio, and Flint, Michigan. Soon 135,000 workers were involved \\nand GM production ground to a halt.\\nWith the sympathetic governor of Michigan refusing to evict the strikers, \\na settlement was reached in early 1937. By September of that year, the United \\nAuto Workers had contracts with 400 companies involved in the automobile \\nindustry, assuring workers a minimum wage of 75 cents per hour and a 40-\\nhour work week.\\nIn the first six months of its existence, the Steel Workers Organizing \\nCommittee (SWOC), headed by Lewis lieutenant Philip Murray, picked up \\n125,000 members. The major American steel company, U.S. Steel, realizing \\nthat times had changed, also came to terms in 1937. That same year the Su-\\npreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the NLRA. Subsequently, smaller \\ncompanies, traditionally even more anti-union than the large corporations, \\ngave in. One by one, other industries — rubber, oil, electronics, and textiles \\n— also followed suit.\\nThe rise of big labor had two major long-term impacts. It became the \\norganizational core of the national Democratic Party, and it gained material \\nbenefits for its members that all but erased the economic distinction between \\nworking-class and middle-class America.  \\ue075'),\n",

In \\n1918 American troops participated \\nin the Allied intervention in Russia \\non behalf of anti-Bolshevik forces  . \\nAmerican diplomatic recognition of \\nthe Soviet Union did not come until \\n1933 . Even then, suspicions persist -\\ned . During World War II, however, \\nthe two countries found themselves \\nallied and downplayed their differ -\\nences to counter the Nazi threat .\\nAt the war’s end, antagonisms \\nsurfaced again  . The United States \\nhoped to share with other countries \\nits conception of liberty, equality, \\nand democracy  . It sought also to \\nlearn from the perceived mistakes of \\nthe post-WWI era, when American \\npolitical disengagement and eco -\\nnomic protectionism were thought \\nto have contributed to the rise of dic-\\ntatorships in Europe and elsewhere  . \\nFaced again with a postwar world \\nof civil wars and disintegrating \\nempires, the nation hoped to pro -\\nvide the stability to make peaceful \\nreconstruction possible  . Recalling \\nthe specter of the Great Depression  \\n(1929-40), America now advocated \\nopen trade for two reasons: to cre -\\nate markets for American agricul -\\ntural and industrial products, and \\nto ensure the ability of Western Eu -\\nropean nations to export as a means \\nof rebuilding their economies  . Re -\\nduced trade barriers, American \\npolicy makers believed, would pro -\\nmote economic growth at home and \\nabroad, bolstering U  .S . friends and \\nallies in the process .\\nThe Soviet Union had its own \\nagenda .

An unpretentious \\nman who had previously served as \\nDemocratic senator from Missouri, \\nthen as vice president, Truman ini -\\ntially felt ill-prepared to govern  . \\nRoosevelt had not discussed com -\\nplex postwar issues with him, and he \\nhad little experience in international \\naffairs . “I’m not big enough for this \\njob,” he told a former colleague . \\nStill, Truman responded quickly \\nto new challenges  . Sometimes im -\\npulsive on small matters, he proved \\nwilling to make hard and carefully \\nconsidered decisions on large ones  . \\nA small sign on his White House \\ndesk declared, “The Buck Stops \\nHere .”  His judgments about how \\nto respond to the Soviet Union ulti -\\nmately determined the shape of the \\nearly Cold War .\\nORIGINS OF THE COLD WAR\\nThe Cold War developed as dif -\\nferences about the shape of the  \\npostwar world created suspicion and \\ndistrust between the United States \\nand the Soviet Union  . The first — \\nand most difficult — test case was \\nPoland, the eastern half of which had \\nbeen invaded and occupied by the \\nUSSR in 1939  . Moscow demanded \\na government subject to Soviet in -\\nfluence; Washington wanted a more \\nindependent, representative govern-\\nment following the Western model  . \\nThe Yalta Conference of February \\n1945 had produced an agreement on \\nEastern Europe open to different in-\\nterpretations . It included a promise \\nof “free and unfettered” elections .\\nMeeting with Soviet Minister \\nof Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Mo -\\nlotov less than two weeks after be -\\ncoming president, Truman stood \\nfirm on Polish self-determination, \\nlecturing the Soviet diplomat about \\nthe need to implement the Yalta ac -\\ncords . When Molotov protested, “I \\nhave never been talked to like that \\nin my life,” Truman retorted, “Carry \\nout your agreements and you won’t \\nget talked to like that .” Relations de-\\nteriorated from that point onward .\\nDuring the closing months of \\nWorld War II, Soviet military forces \\noccupied all of Central and Eastern \\nEurope . Moscow used its military \\npower to support the efforts of the \\nCommunist parties in Eastern Eu -\\nrope and crush the democratic par -\\nties . Communists took over one \\nnation after another  . The process \\nconcluded with a shocking coup \\nd’etat in Czechoslovakia in 1948 .\\nPublic statements defined the be-\\nginning of the Cold War  . In 1946 \\nStalin declared that international \\npeace was impossible “under the \\npresent capitalist development of \\nthe world economy .” Former British \\nPrime Minister Winston Churchill \\ndelivered a dramatic speech in Ful -\\nton, Missouri, with Truman sitting \\non the platform  . “From Stettin in \\nthe Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic,” \\nChurchill said, “an iron curtain has \\nCHAPTER 12: POSTWAR AMERICA'),\n",

In early 1946, the Unit -\\ned States demanded, and obtained, \\na full Soviet withdrawal from Iran, \\nthe northern half of which it had oc-\\ncupied during the war  . That sum -\\nmer, the United States pointedly \\nsupported Turkey against Soviet \\ndemands for control of the Turkish \\nstraits between the Black Sea and the \\nMediterranean . In early 1947, Amer-\\nican policy crystallized when Britain \\ntold the United States that it could \\nno longer afford to support the gov-\\nernment of Greece against a strong \\nCommunist insurgency .\\nIn a strongly worded speech to \\nCongress, Truman declared, “I be -\\nlieve that it must be the policy of the \\nUnited States to support free peoples \\nwho are resisting attempted subjuga-\\ntion by armed minorities or by out -\\nside pressures  .” Journalists quickly \\ndubbed this statement the “Truman \\nDoctrine .” The president asked  \\nCongress to provide $400 million for \\neconomic and military aid, mostly to \\nGreece but also to Turkey  . After an \\nemotional debate that resembled the \\none between interventionists and \\nisolationists before World War II, the \\nmoney was appropriated .\\nCritics from the left later charged \\nthat to whip up American support \\nfor the policy of containment, Tru -\\nman overstated the Soviet threat to \\nthe United States .

Chiang had been a \\nwar-time ally, but his government \\nwas hopelessly inefficient and cor -\\nrupt .

Stressing spontaneity and \\nspirituality, they preferred intuition \\nover reason, Eastern mysticism over \\nWestern institutionalized religion .\\nThe literary work of the beats \\ndisplayed their sense of alienation \\nand quest for self-realization  .

The United States \\nlaunched its first satellite, Explorer I, \\nin 1958 . But three months after Ken-\\nnedy became president, the USSR \\nput the first man in orbit  .

Gemini also accom -\\nplished the first manned linkup of \\ntwo spacecraft in flight as well as the \\nfirst U .S . walks in space . \\n The three-person Apollo space -\\ncraft achieved Kennedy’s goal and \\ndemonstrated to the world that the \\nUnited States had surpassed Soviet \\ncapabilities in space  .

At the same time, however, \\nthe country has produced a plethora of third and minor parties over the years. \\nFor example, 58 parties were represented on at least one state ballot during \\nthe 1992 presidential elections. Among these were obscure parties such as the \\nApathy, the Looking Back, the New Mexico Prohibition, the Tish Independent \\nCitizens, and the Vermont Taxpayers.\\nThird parties organize around a single issue or set of issues. They tend \\nto fare best when they have a charismatic leader. With the presidency out of \\nreach, most seek a platform to publicize their political and social concerns.\\nTheodore Roosevelt. The most successful third-party candidate of \\nthe 20th century was a Republican, Theodore Roosevelt, the former presi-\\ndent. His Progressive or Bull Moose Party won 27.4 percent of the vote in the \\n1912 election. The progressive wing of the Republican Party, having grown \\ndisenchanted with President William Howard Taft, whom Roosevelt had \\nhand-picked as his successor, urged Roosevelt to seek the party nomination in \\n1912. This he did, defeating Taft in a number of primaries. Taft controlled the \\nparty machinery, however, and secured the nomination.\\nRoosevelt’s supporters then broke away and formed the Progressive Party. \\nDeclaring himself as fit as a bull moose (hence the party’s popular name), \\nRoosevelt campaigned on a platform of regulating “big business,” women’s \\nsuffrage, a graduated income tax, the Panama Canal, and conservation. His \\neffort was sufficient to defeat Taft. By splitting the Republican vote, however, \\nhe helped ensure the election of the Democrat Woodrow Wilson.\\nSocialists. The Socialist Party also reached its high point in 1912,  \\nattaining 6 percent of the popular vote. Perennial candidate Eugene Debs won \\nnearly 900,000 votes that year, advocating collective ownership of the trans-\\nportation and communication industries, shorter working hours, and public \\nworks projects to spur employment. Convicted of sedition during World War I, \\nDebs campaigned from his cell in 1920.\\nRobert La Follette. Another Progressive was Senator Robert La Fol-\\nlette, who won more than 16 percent of the vote in the 1924 election. Long a \\nchampion of farmers and industrial workers, and an ardent foe of big business, \\nLa Follette was a prime mover in the recreation of the Progressive movement \\nfollowing World War I. Backed by the farm and labor vote, as well as by  \\nSocialists and remnants of Roosevelt’s Bull Moose Party, La Follette ran on \\na platform of nationalizing railroads and the country’s natural resources.

He carried only his home state of Wisconsin.\\nHenry Wallace. The Progressive Party reinvented itself in 1948 with \\nthe nomination of Henry Wallace, a former secretary of agriculture and vice \\npresident under Franklin Roosevelt. Wallace’s 1948 platform opposed the \\nCold War, the Marshall Plan, and big business. He also campaigned to end \\ndiscrimination against African Americans and women, backed a minimum \\nwage, and called for the elimination of the House Committee on Un-Ameri-\\ncan Activities. His failure to repudiate the U.S. Communist Party, which had \\nendorsed him, undermined his popularity and he wound up with just over 2.4 \\npercent of the popular vote.\\nDixiecrats. Like the Progressives, the States Rights or Dixiecrat Party, \\nled by South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond, emerged in 1948 as a spin-off  \\nfrom the Democratic Party. Its opposition stemmed from Truman’s civil rights \\nplatform. Although defined in terms of “states’ rights,” the party’s goal was \\ncontinuing racial segregation and the “Jim Crow” laws that sustained it.\\nGeorge Wallace. The racial and social upheavals of the 1960s helped \\nbring George Wallace, another segregationist Southern governor, to national \\nattention. Wallace built a following through his colorful attacks against civil \\nrights, liberals, and the federal government. Founding the American Indepen-\\ndent Party in 1968, he ran his campaign from the statehouse in Montgomery, \\nAlabama, winning 13.5 percent of the overall presidential vote.\\nH. Ross Perot. Every third party seeks to capitalize on popular dis-\\nsatisfaction with the major parties and the federal government. At few times in \\nrecent history, however, has this sentiment been as strong as it was during the \\n1992 election. A hugely wealthy Texas businessman, Perot possessed a knack \\nfor getting his message of economic common sense and fiscal responsibility \\nacross to a wide spectrum of the people.  Lampooning the nation’s leaders and \\nreducing his economic message to easily understood formulas, Perot found \\nlittle difficulty gaining media attention. His campaign organization, United We \\nStand, was staffed primarily by volunteers and backed by his personal fortune. \\nFar from resenting his wealth, many admired Perot’s business success and the \\nfreedom it brought him from soliciting campaign funds from special interests. \\nPerot withdrew from the race in July. Re-entering it a month before the elec-\\ntion, he won over 19 million votes as the Reform Party standard-bearer, nearly \\n19 percent of the total cast. This was by far the largest number ever tallied by \\na third-party candidate and second only to Theodore Roosevelt’s 1912 show-\\ning as a percentage of the total.  \\ue075'),\n",

Some were former elites who lost property, others were common people loyal to the King.  The initial idea of complete separation from England was repugnant to many in the Continental Congress, who initially adopted the Olive Branch Petition to avoid further conflict.  Despite initial American setbacks, like the Battle of Long Island where Washington executed a retreat, American tenacity led to victories.  The Second Continental Congress met in May 10, voted to go to war, appointed George Washington commander-in-chief, and ordered expeditions into Canada (though the assault on Quebec ultimately failed).  The Americans suffered high casualties at Bunker Hill.  The maintenance of a free republic was thought to require communal responsibility and self-denying virtue from leaders, although the relationship between individual rights and republicanism was seen by many as two sides of the same coin.',\n",
